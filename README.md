Our prototype connects to the “Removing Barriers to Learning” brief as we are trying to create accessibility to textbooks, which are an essential part of university learning. The current common approaches that could be used to find textbook alternatives are to search through facebook posts or to search the web for pdf versions. However, these methods are inconvenient and do not always work. The barrier we are specifically trying to tackle is the barrier students face when trying to obtain textbooks, and we attempt to solve this by creating an easy to access space to find affordable textbooks instead of having to scour the web for them. 
Prototype 2 is an iteration from storyboard 1. It is an app that allows users who want to find cheaper alternatives to buying a textbook online to connect with students who want to sell the textbooks that they already own. This solution is a convenient way for students to access second-hand textbooks.
